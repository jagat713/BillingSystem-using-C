This project is a simple billing system implemented in C++. It allows users to input customer details, item details, calculates the total bill amount including GST, and processes payments.

Features
User authentication with a predefined username and password.
Input of customer details including name and mobile number.
Input of item details including name, quantity, and price.
Calculation of total bill amount including GST.
Option to include carry bag charges in the bill.
Payment processing with cash given and change calculation.
Receipt generation.
Usage
Compile the Code:
Execute the compiled program.

Login:
Enter the predefined username and password to access the billing system.
Enter Customer and Item Details:

Follow the prompts to enter customer details and item details.
Review and Confirm:

Make Payment:

Enter the cash given by the customer.
Receipt:

The program will generate a receipt displaying the total items, total amount, cash given, and change.
Security Considerations
Password Security:
The program uses a simple password authentication mechanism. For real-world applications, use more secure methods like hashing and salting.
Improvements
Input Validation:
Implement input validation to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
Error Handling:
Improve error handling for scenarios such as insufficient cash given or failed transactions.
Code Refactoring:
Refactor the code to improve modularity and readability, possibly splitting it into functions.
Documentation:
Add comments to explain the code logic and improve readability.
User Interface:
Enhance the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
